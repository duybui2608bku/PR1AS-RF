Design a service marketplace UI inspired by Airbnb.

Base style:
Minimalism & Swiss Style – clean, grid-based, clarity-first.

Layout system:
Bento Grid cards for homepage and featured sections.

Interaction:
Subtle micro-interactions (50–100ms) for hover, press, and loading states.

Accessibility:
WCAG AA+ contrast, keyboard navigation, clear focus states.

Visual rules:
White background, neutral tones.
One primary brand accent color only.
No heavy gradients, no neumorphism, no flashy effects.

UX goal:
Fast scanning, trust building, easy comparison.
